MEETING MINUTES
Participants: Prof. Lauer, Matt Heon, Dolan Murvihill

Discussion:
* Discussed progress from last week
** Dolan worked on installing Hadoop on local system; Hadoop seems to have out
   of date documentation everywhere and it is very difficult to get started.
   Wrote a local program and can expand to bigger architecture as needed.
** Matt created an anonymization script; it lets a few names through, so we
   will count on our advisor to check for names.
** Dolan reached out to CS and BCB to try to find computing resources; no
   response.
** Matt found some literature on the field.
