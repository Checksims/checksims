MEETING MINUTES
Participants: Prof. Lauer, Matt Heon, Dolan Murvihill
Date: 9/2/2014

Discussion:
* Discussed initial architecture.
** Server will perform similarity detection computation
** All information from check will be reported to the client
** Client will parse information to produce readable report on similarities
   within the class.
* Discussed requirement for anonymization script for test data
** Cannot use test data unmodified, contains names of submitting students
** Solution: Write script to strip this information, anonymize source code
** Matt has sample data from classes I have TA'd which can be used to test the
   script.

Goals for Next Week:
* Write anonymization script to remove student names from source code
* Write architectural description document.
** Detail functionality of server and client
** Propose server API for client use
* Identify available hardware resources for development - does CS dept have a
  mapreduce configuration available?
* Locate major literature on plagiarism detection (slash source code similarity
  detection)
* Locate a reference manager to use
* Design & Begin Implementation of Evaluation Framework (test harness for
  overall solution, evaluating correctness, false positive/negative rate, etc)
