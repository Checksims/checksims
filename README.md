checksims
=========

software similarity detection service

Usage:
A proper readme is coming soon. In the meantime, we have a nice User's Guide in
the Latex docs (also under construction).

The demo will compute and print a matrix of similarity between the files.

Known Dependencies:
 - texmk, pdflatex, and make are required to build the documents.
 - Building the documents also requires the biblatex package for LaTeX, with the
   biber backend.
