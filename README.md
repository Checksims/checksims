checksims
=========

software similarity detection service

A proper readme is coming soon. In the meantime, we have a nice User's Guide in
the Latex docs (also under construction).

The demo will compute and print a matrix of similarity between the files.

Known Dependencies for building the docs:
 - make
 - texmk
 - pdflatex
 - biblatex
 - biber

Currently no binary distribution is available. We may change that some day.
