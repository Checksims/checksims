software similarity detection service

Usage:
Currently, the only project is lineCompare, with main class LineCompareDemo.
You should be able to compile the project to an executable jar,
linecompare-demo.jar. Then run:

java -jar linecompare-demo.jar [fname] ...

The demo will compute and print a matrix of similarity between the files.

Known Dependencies:
pdflatex and make are required to build the documents.
mockito is required to build and run the test suite. We recommend version 1.9.5
