/**
 * The Submission package contains all classes related to Submissions.
 *
 * A Submission contains all the code for a single submission of a single assignment. Checksims compares a number of
 * Submissions for similarities. Submissions are typically formed by reading all files matching a given pattern in a
 * directory, concatenating them, and tokenizing the results (using the methods in the base Submission interface).
 * However, Submissions can be constructed on their own by instantiating a ConcreteSubmission.
 *
 * Submission itself is an interface with one concrete implementation and a number of decorators.
