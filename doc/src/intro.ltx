\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Over the past year, we have heard reports of a number of cases of academic
dishonesty occurring at WPI. Specifically, most of these have concerned the
unauthorized and unacknowledged copying of source code within the Electrical
and Computer Engineering and Computer Science departments. The first reports
came from Nicholas DeMarinis, a Teaching Assistant in the Electrical and
Computer Engineering department, who noticed several instances of source code
which he considered to be suspiciously similar in an embedded systems
programming course. He identified several cases of academic dishonesty,
including one where the students had extensively obfuscated the copied code.

Meanwhile, Professor Lauer of the Computer Science department found several
instances of academic dishonesty in his own courses. A member of the course
staff of a low-level programming class he was teaching found a pair of students
who submitted near-identical assignments, which he brought to Professor Lauer's
attention. Several assignments later, another member of the course staff
identified another set of students with very similar assignments --- this time,
by noticing that both students had submitted assignments which had identical,
incorrect output.

In both of these cases, the unauthorized copying was caught mostly by luck.
Both courses had more than one teaching assistant; if the two assignments which
contained unauthorized copying were graded by different teaching assistants,
the copying would almost certainly not have been identified. This draws
questions to how many cases of academic dishonesty occurred which were not
identified.

The issue does not appear to be that course staff cannot identify unauthorized
copying when it is present. Instead, there are so many assignments that the
staff could not possibly review all of them to identify such cases. The
problem is one of data overload, which is a field computers are well-equipped
to deal with. A solution for flagging \emph{potential} cases of unauthorized 
copying for review by course staff has the potential to greatly increase
detection of academic dishonesty.
 
Professor Lauer commissioned the authors to construct a system for
automatically detecting suspicious assignments, with the intent of integrating
it into his low-level courses as a tool to identify which assignments require
manual review.
