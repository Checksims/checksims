\section{Definitions of plagiarism}
Definitions of plagiarism are many and varied.

%  Reasons for plagiarism
%    Joy99
%      "A weak student produces work in close collaboration with a colleague, in
%        the belief that it is acceptable."
%      "A weak student copies, and then edits, a colleage’s program, with or
%        without the colleage’s permission, hoping that this will go unnoticed."
%      "A poorly motivated (but not necessarily weak) student copies, and then
%        edits, a colleague’s program, with the intention of minimizing the work
%        needed."

\section{Technical characteristics of plagiarism detection}
\subsection{Human analysis requirement}
The proliferation of plagiarism definitions creates a vague, confusing, and
potentially dangerous situation for students. While mitigating the problems
caused by this quagmire is outside the scope of this project, it is important
to recognize that even a detector that is "perfect" (no false positives or
false negatives) under one definition of plagiarism will not be perfect for a
professor using a different definition. What this means is that in making a
final determination on a suspicious pair, there is no substitute for a human.

\subsection{High false positive tolerance}
There is a silver lining, though: because a human is making the final
determination, the cost of a false positive drops from a false accusation of
plagiarism (which is huge) to a small amount of time for the course staff to
review the match. The low cost of a false positive means we can use very
sensitive algorithms and be relatively confident that we can catch (almost)
all plagiarism.

\subsection{Obfuscation Techniques}Plagiarists often try to evade detection by
obfuscating their copied document.
Plagiarists often try to evade detection by obfuscating their copied document.
In order to assist in developing countermeasures against obfuscation, some
researchers have attempted to characterize these techniques. The best paper on
this topic, by Parker, identifies six "levels" of obfuscation, from a straight,
un-altered file copy (no obfuscation) to sophisticated attacks like refactoring
while loops to for loops and other algebraic translations. Any decent
plagiarism detector should be able to counter the lower level normalizations,
but challenges like algebraic refactoring are more difficult for the
implementor as well as the plagiarist.

\subsection{Document fingerprinting}
Document fingerprinting approaches require storing specific elements of one
document or source file, and searching for those elements in another file. One
advantage of most document fingerprinting approaches is that the fingerprints
can be stored in one place, requiring each document to be checked against one
database ($O(n)$ time) rather than comparing each pair of documents ($O(n^2)$).

\subsubsection{COpy Protection System (COPS)}
A good example of a very old document fingerprinting system is COPS. COPS
facilitates \vocab{ordinary operational tests}, including subset, related, and
plagiarism. The system document into \vocab{units}, sequences of words
separated by end-of-sentence markers, and then groups them into, \vocab{chunks}
according to a \vocab{chunking strategy}. Hashes of the chunks were then stored
and retrieved in the database. In COPS, chunks are not related to the
underlying structure of the document.

\subsubsection{n-gram fingerprinting}
By far the most common document fingerprinting approach is called n-gram
fingerprinting. The document is tokenized, and considered in sequences of $n$
tokens, or \vocab{n-grams}. The n-grams overlap, so that there an $m$ character
document will be considered as $m-n+1$ n-grams. The hashes of these n-grams are
stored in a database and checked against those from other documents. The hashes
are usually stored with a pointer to their occurrence to aid in detection.

[illustration here]

Most plagiarism corpora are far too large to store all n-grams from all
documents. Usually, a selection algorithm is used to select a subset of the
n-grams to serve as the document's \vocab{fingerprints}, but that entails
information loss: even word-for-word identical documents will only match if
they both contain an n-gram that was selected as a fingerprint, so how the
fingerprints are selected is very important. A very simple approach is to
select n-grams whose hashes are divisible by some number $p$
\cite{schleimer03}, but this technique can leave gaps of arbitrary length
between fingerprints, so that a large chunk of plagiarized text might slip by.

Schleimer, Wilkerson, and Aiken presented an alternative fingerprint selection
algorithm in 2003 called \vocab{winnowing}. After dividing the document's
tokens into n-grams, winnowing further divides the n-grams into \vocab{windows}
of size $t$. Winnowing always selects the minimum hash from each window,
guaranteeing that a match of $t$ or more consecutive tokens will be identified.

[illustration here]

Winnowing has proven to be extremely powerful; it is used by the current
industry standard source code similarity detector, MOSS, where the authors
claim that "false positives appear to be non-existent, and the infrequent
reports of false negatives have always been tracked back either to
implementation bugs or user error" \cite{schleimer03}. We doubt the picture is
that spectacular, but there is no doubt that MOSS is a very successful
platform.
