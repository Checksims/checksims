In response to growing academic dishonesty in undergraduate computer science
and electrical and computer engineering courses, we present \textit{checksims},
a similarity detector designed to highlight suspicious assignments for
instructor review. We report the design rationale for the software, and describe
our discovery of dozens of previously undetected cases of academic dishonesty
in such classes.
