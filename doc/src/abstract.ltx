In response to growing academic dishonesty in low-level computer science and
electrical and computer engineering courses, we present \textit{Checksims}, a
similarity detector designed to highlight suspicious assignments for instructor
review. We report the design rationale for the software, and describe our
detection of dozens of previously undetected cases of academic dishonesty in
previous classes.
