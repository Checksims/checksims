In response to growing academic dishonesty in undergraduate computer science
and electrical and computer engineering courses, we present
\textit{Checksims}, a similarity detector designed to highlight suspicious
assignments for instructor review. We report the design rationale for the
software, and describe our detection of dozens of previously undetected cases
of academic dishonesty in such classes.
