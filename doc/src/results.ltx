\section{Results}
The experiments described in Section~\ref{sec:methods} were performed on the
anonymized student data we obtained as test data. This section summarizes their
results, and attempts to draw conclusions about the state of \textit{Checksims}
and its algorithms from them.

\subsection{Algorithm Comparison}
Our algorithm comparison tests, described in Section~\ref{sec:algcompare},
were split into three overall tests. The first compared the overall number of
results detected by each algorithm across all our test data. The second
compared the running times of both algorithms across all test data. The third
and final test compared the results returned by the two algorithms for a subset
of all the assignments, to determine what matches were identified by one
algorithm but not another.


\subsubsection{Overall Results Detected}
Figure~\ref{fig:algocompare} shows all results from applying both algorithms
to every assignment in the test data. Results under 70\% are not shown, as they
are less interesting (a far lower proportion will be cases of unauthorized
copying) and they are orders of magnitude more than the significant results. It
is clear that \textit{Smith-Waterman} is a far more sensitive algorithm than
\textit{Line Comparison}, detecting a great many more instances in every range
save 100\% similarity (which both algorithms should be able to detect easily).
This sensitivity is not necessarily an indicator of accuracy, however; it is
possible that all of the results reported by \textit{Smith-Waterman} are simply
false positives. Given the obvious limitations of the \textit{Line Comparison}
algorithm (detailed in Section~\ref{sec:linecompare}), we do not believe this
to be the case. A large number of the additional results found by
\textit{Smith-Waterman} are almost certainly real instances of unauthorized
copying (or, at the least, cases which should have been brought to the
attention of course staff for manual review). This matches our hypothesis that
\textit{Smith-Waterman} is the more accurate of the two algorithms (though,
again, we cannot prove this with only these results).

It is noteworthy that we removed common code from all assignments in our test
data which we knew to contain it. In several cases, we were unable to obtain
the common code from the instructors who gave the assignment. For these cases,
we identified one student who had 100\% similarity to all others. On further
examination, these students typically had submitted no code save the common
starter code. Consequently, we were able to use their submissions as common
code for these assignments.

\end{figure}


\paragraph{Previous Undiscovered Academic Dishonesty}
As Figure~\ref{fig:algocompare} shows, the \textit{Smith-Waterman} algorithm
identified 17 cases of 100\% similarity, and a further 35 over 90\%. As was
mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:anon}, all our test data is taken from actual
courses --- previous offering of low-level Computer Science classes. Given
this, we can assume that the results in Figure~\ref{fig:algocompare} represent
a large number of cases of academic dishonesty, though we cannot say how many
of the reported results are actually cases of academic dishonesty. We can,
however, draw reasonable inferences.

The 100\% results are almost certainly cases of academic dishonesty. The notion
that two students could have typed in 100\% identical code separately is
absurd. We investigated several of these pairs, and all we found were what we
consider to be academic dishonesty. Results from the 90\% to 99\% range are
also nearly-certain cases of academic dishonesty. We reviewed 6 of these pairs
of assignments, and found that all of them match our definition of academic
dishonesty.

The 70\% to 89\% range, however, contains a number of similarities which may
not be caused by academic dishonesty. In some cases, students implemented the
same algorithm in very similar ways. Given that there are not many ways to
write a simple algorithm (for example, Bubblesort), especially if typical loop
counter conventions (\texttt{i} for outermost loop, \texttt{j} for next
innermost, etc) are followed. Six of the nine courses we obtained code from
were offerings of CS2301, an intro-level course targeted at non-Computer
Science majors. Most assignments for CS2301 will be very simple, requiring only
trivial algorithms (without much variation in algorithm choice or
implementation). Furthermore, Professor Lauer permits the copying of algorithms
out of the textbook, so students may end up with completely identical versions
of simple functions (like binary tree insertion). Given this, many similarities
in the 70\% to 89\% range may have produced their code independently, but using
very similar algorithms and pseudocode --- perfectly acceptable, according to
Professor Lauer.

The potential difference between the two assignments which form our test data
is emphasized by the graph in Figure~\ref{fig:classcompare}. Almost all
similarities identified are from CS2301, despite it only containing
approximately 70\% of our test code. Given this, the smaller similarities seen
may well be due to the reasons identified in the previous paragraph.

Even discounting a large number of the similarities present as potentially not
cases of academic dishonesty, our results do paint a concerning picture of
undetected past incidences of academic dishonesty within CS2301. Many of these
courses were taught by Professor Lauer, and he can confirm that almost none of
the near-certain cases we identified (90\% and higher) were caught. We hope
that the deployment of \textit{Checksims} may be able to reduce these numbers
as word of its use spreads.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Runtime Comparison}
Figure~\ref{fig:smithwatermanruntime} shows the runtime of the
\textit{Smith-Waterman} algorithm for every assignment in our dataset. No
assignment took over 2400 seconds (40 minutes) to complete, and the vast
majority finished in under 360 seconds (6 minutes). We originally intended to
produce a comparative graph also showing results from \textit{Line Comparison},
but the results from that algorithm were sufficiently similar that we did not
deem it necessary to graph them. No assignment took longer than 1 second to
complete using \textit{Line Comparison}; the graph, compared to the results
from \textit{Smith-Waterman}, would be a flat line slightly above 0. This
supports our hypothesis that \textit{Line Comparison} is the faster of the two
algorithms, and confirms its usefulness as a fast initial pass to identify
highly similar submissions.

It is noteworthy that, while no assignment shown completed in over 2400 seconds
(40 minutes), we were forced to manually intervene on one occasion. The
algorithm hung for 4 hours performing similarity detection on one pair of
students on one assignment in our sample data (and likely would have run much
longer, had we not ended it prematurely). We investigated the assignment more
closely, and found that two students had submitted an unorthodox solution using
large sets of lookup tables. The two assignments were sufficiently different to
remove unauthorized copying as a factor; we believe they both came upon the
solution independently. The pair of assignments using these lookup tables were
approximately 3000 and 3500 lines each, and were approximately 13000 and 15000
tokens after being run through the default tokenizer of the
\textit{Smith-Waterman} algorithm. In comparison, typical student submissions
for this assignment were perhaps 100 lines of code, and 300 to 400 tokens in
size. By removing these two assignments from the comparison, we were able to
reduce the runtime of Smith-Waterman to around one minute.

\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Algorithm Comparison}
Figure~\ref{fig:resultsbyalgo} shows the results from 6 randomly-selected
assignments from the overall dataset. The results are grouped by assignment,
and show how many results were detected by each algorithm for each of the
assignments. It is immediately clear that, for two of the six assignments, the
results for \textit{Line Comparison} are strict subsets of those from
\textit{Smith-Waterman}. However, the trend is somewhat reversed for
assignments three and five, where a majority of results were detected by
\textit{Line Comparison} and not by \textit{Smith-Waterman}. Manual review of
these results indicates that most of these results are cases of one student
submitting very little to no code (typically in the dozens of lines, with many
being trivially simple - for example, \} or \texttt{return;}). Many of these
lines are also contained in larger assignments, so the trivial assignment
appears to be very similar to larger assignments to \textit{Line Comparison}
(the larger assignments typically display inverse similarities which are very
small --- 5 to 20\% being common). \textit{Smith-Waterman} has awareness of the
ordering of tokens within a document, and consequently will ignore trivial
sequences like \texttt{\{ return; \}} if they are not present in the submission
being compared to in an almost-identical form. Through this, we can conclude
that almost all results detected by \textit{Line Comparison} but not
\textit{Smith-Waterman} are false positives, providing further evidence for the
accuracy of the \textit{Smith-Waterman} algorithm.

TODO GRAPHS AND ANALYSIS

\section{Real-World Usage}
During development, \textit{Checksims} was used in real-world situations on two
occasions. Course staff (including one of the authors) made use of development
versions of the program to attempt to identify academic dishonesty in
student submissions in ongoing courses. Though results from these real-world
uses cannot be published due to aforementioned privacy concerns, they provided
valuable insight into how \textit{Checksims} would be used in typical class.


\subsection{Embedded Design Course}
The first usage of \textit{Checksims} was by an Electrical and Computer
Engineering teaching assistant, Nicholas DeMarinis. On the course staff of a
course making extensive use of microcontrollers and C code, he became
concerned that some of his students may have been collaborating above and
beyond was was allowed by course rules. He requested an early version of
\textit{Checksims} to verify his suspicions, which the authors provided.
Though we are unaware of what results he obtained through its application, he
provided valuable feedback on improving the usability of the program. He
requested the ability to remove common code from a submission and an output
format suitable for import into a spreadsheet program for performing statistics
calculations, both of which are present in \textit{Checksims} as of the time of
this writing.


\subsection{Assembly and Computer Organization}
A nearly-complete version of \textit{Checksims} was applied to the first
assignment in a course for which one of the authors, Matthew Heon, was a
teaching assistant. This assignment was an excercise in optimization and
bitwise operations, and was composed of a relatively small C project with a
great deal of common code. \textit{Checksims} detected three students with
extremely similar submissions who would not otherwise have been identified,
given that the assignment was graded programmatically, with very little human
interaction between course staff and student submissions.
