Checksims To-Do
===============

Unit Tests
----------
- Additional CLI parsing tests
- Integration tests
- Smith-Waterman Algorithm has 2 untested methods

Project Administration
----------------------
- Clean up README
- Release Engineering process
- Generate User's Guide for each version as PDF, and place in project root.

Code Cleanup
------------
- Exception rewrite. Convert many RuntimeExceptions to checked exceptions
- Add ability to blacklist certain implementations in a registry
- Change Common Code Removal to a preprocessor
- Clean up CLI argument parsing exception handling - print user-readable errors

Minor Improvements
------------------
- Add support for more than 1 archive directory (multiple uses of --archive flag)
- Add support for using only a single base submission if archive submissions are provided
- Add handling for empty submissions (flag to include, default do not include)
- Leading and Trailing Whitespace Trimming Preprocessor
- Further optimization of Smith-Waterman Algorithm
- HTML output should have a rotated (45 degree) X axis, to reduce size
- Output to JSON, containing all AlgorithmResults used to build similarity matrix

Major new features
------------------
- Comment stripping preprocessors
- Greedy String Tiling algorithm
- Token Annotations
- REST API and web interface

Major Reworks
-------------
- Framework for non-pairwise comparisons (possible with shared state)
- Framework for new types of Tokens (AST-based, character-backed, etc)
